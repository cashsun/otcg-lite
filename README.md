Mini IDE for a specific custom use case.


This app is built with CodeMirror Plug-in to help Credit Suisse Equity Derivatives IT Risk team to generate trade valuation definition JSON based on params(trade type, trade date, legs etc.) from users. The definition used to be built upon very few templates and involves quite a lot manual effort. The web app uses the idea of auto-hint from IDEs to generate (called 'Grind' in the app) parts of the final definition step by step.
